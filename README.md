# Prediction of Product Sales
## Predicting how many food items will be sold
### Author: Carlo Lopez

## Business Problem
I will predict sales for food items sold at various stores. The goal of this is to help the stakeholder understand the properties of products and outlets that play crucial roles in increasing sales.

## Data
There is different types of information ranging from item fat content to outlet sizes. Each feature or columns have their own role in increasing the sales.
## Methods
- I dropped columns item identifier, outlet identifier, and outlet establishment year because they are not relevant or something we can not change.


## Results 
### Weight of food items

This is one of many visualizations in my project. This particular plot is called a bar plot and shows us how much the items weigh and how many there are.
### Correlation between sales

The heat map is another type of plot. This plot spots out any values that are correlated with eachother.
