# Prediction-of-Product-Sales

In my first project I will be predicting sales of food products from different stores.

This is one of many visualizations in my project. This particular plot is called a bar plot and shows us how much the items weigh and how many there are.

The heat map is another type of plot. This plot spots out any values that are correlated with eachother.
